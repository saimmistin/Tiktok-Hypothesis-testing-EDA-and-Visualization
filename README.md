Welcome to the TikTok Hypothesis Testing, EDA, and Visualization project repository! This project focuses on analyzing and exploring a dataset related to TikTok videos through hypothesis testing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization techniques.

## Problem Background
TikTok users have the ability to submit reports that identify videos and comments that contain user claims. These reports identify content that needs to be reviewed by moderators. I will be working on the development of a predictive model that can determine whether a video contains a claim or offers an opinion. 

## Project Overview
Notebooks: Jupyter notebooks containing the code for data preprocessing, hypothesis testing, EDA, and visualization.
Data: Sample TikTok dataset used for the analysis.
Results: Visualizations, charts, and summaries of findings.
